# Information
This is a Multilayer Perceptron implementation for the university course "Computational Intelligence" written in C++ and 
Jupyter Notebook(Python) for visualization. This neural network solves a classification problem with two dimensional points that belong in 5 different categories.
# Run  
`g++ datasets.cpp` and `a.exe` on Windows ( or `./a.out` on Linux) for the creation of the datasets.  
`g++ mlp.cpp` and `a.exe` to train and run the neural network.  
The visualization is done by opening and running the `plot.ipynb` file through Jupyter Notebook.
